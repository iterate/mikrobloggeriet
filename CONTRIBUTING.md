## Installation
Developing on Mikrobloggeriet.no requires some setup.



### Brew
Mikrobloggeriet is developed in [Clojure]. 
```shell
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
```
For more information on installing Clojure, read the official [Clojure installation Guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure).


Clojure is primarily hosted on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that a JVM is required to compile and execute Clojure code.
We recommend 



```shell
brew install --cask temurin
```


```shell
brew install pandoc
```
