## How do I write docs?

Please see [CLI quickstart] to get started writing content.

[CLI quickstart]: cli-quickstart-mblog.md

Note: we previously used cohort-specific CLI applications.
These are replaced by `mblog`, a CLI that can be used to write documents for any cohort.
We recommend users of the previous CLI to migrate to `mblog`.
